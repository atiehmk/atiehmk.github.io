      <p class="project-description">
       This project presents a cloud connected mobile application and a cloud-based architecture to modify the energy consumption behavior. By identifying and evaluating the requirements for designing an effective eco-feedback system, the mobile application presents the individual customerâ€™s energy consumption, price of electricity and their contribution to carbon emissions .It also helps the consumers determine the best time to use their appliances in order to maximize their savings. In addition, providing recommended actions, different types of comparisons, and integrating gamification principles can motivate long-term energy-efficient behavior.

      <p class="project-description">
    A mobile Ecological Momentary Assessment (mEMA) for monitoring and managing pain. The system utilizes a mobile application that allows users to report their pain symptoms and associated factors in real-time. The collected data will be timestamped and analyzed to identify pain patterns, triggers, and the effectiveness of interventions. The mEMA system also provides personalized recommendations and reminders based on the reported data, empowering individuals to actively manage their pain. This project seeks to enhance pain management strategies by leveraging the benefits of real-time data collection, personalization, increased self-awareness, and remote monitoring, ultimately improving the overall well-being and quality of life for individuals experiencing pain
